      <h1>Pre-Order Items</h1>
      <p>
        Pre-ordered items are not available to ship at the time of purchase -
        these items are available to ship once all items are received by Lily
        Pad Paper & Co.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any unanticipated production delays for pre-order items do happen and we
        will always communicate the latest updates to you via Instagram
        announcements.
      </p>
      <p>A FEW THINGS TO NOTE WHEN PURCHASING PRE-ORDER ITEMS:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Payment is processed immediately at checkout.</li>
        <li>
          If your purchase includes a pre-order item, your order will not be
          shipped until the pre-order item is available.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Pre-orders are made available on selected products throughout the year.
      </p>
